## Setting Up Firebase

To configure Firebase in your project, youâ€™ll need to add a `Firebase.ts` file in the `src` directory with your Firebase configuration details.

1. Visit the Firebase Console and set up a new project or use an existing one.

2. In the project settings, locate the Firebase configuration code (you can find this under Project Settings > General > Your Apps).

3. Create a new file named `Firebase.ts` in the `src` folder, and paste the Firebase configuration code provided by Firebase into this file. For example:

```typescript
// src/Firebase.ts
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
  messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

export default app;
